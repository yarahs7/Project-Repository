## How to run the streamlit app

### Running the Streamlit app for development

Make sure you have installed the correct packages.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Change into this directory. You can check that you're in the correct directory by running `ls`. 
You should see the correct files printed out.

```shell
ls
app.py             data_fetcher.py       internals.py  modules_test.py  requirements.txt
custom_components  data_fetcher_test.py  modules.py    README.md        run-streamlit.sh
```

Run the following command to run the app locally. Note that if you make changes, you just
need to refresh the server and the new changes should appear (you do not need to rerun
the following command while you are actively making changes).

```shell
streamlit run app.py
```

### Using Docker to run the Streamlit app

Docker simply creates a virtual environment for only your app. This is what we will use to
deploy our app continuously.

Fortunately, we already have a script that builds and starts Docker for us. Run the 
following command to build the container and start the server locally.

```shell
./run-streamlit.sh
```

## Setting up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

The GitHub Actions are already mostly configured for you. They are split
into two files:

* `.github/workflows/cloud-run.yml`: workflow for automatic deployment
* `.github/workflows/python-checks.yml`: workflow for continuous integration (testing)

You won't need to modify `python-checks` at all, but you will need to change
the environment variables in `cloud-run.yml` to work for your team's GCP project.

### Deploy manually on the command-line

First, deploy your project manually from the command line.

1. Set up your Google Cloud Project by following the "Before you begin" section of 
http://cloud/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-python-service?hl=en. **Each student can do this with their own Cloud project to start.**

2. Build the image using the following commands, replacing the project ID and service 
name with your info. Your service name is the name of your webapp or project and can 
be whatever you want! The first two lines here are **bash variables**: if you set bash variables, the rest of the commands can be copy-pasted exactly, without replacing anything!

```shell
PROJECT_ID=your-cloud-project-name  # run this line in the terminal after adding your project name
SERVICE_NAME=your-team-service-name  # run this line in the terminal after adding your team's service name

# run the below command exactly (do not change anything!) the bash variables set above will get populated here
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${SERVICE_NAME}
```

3. Deploy the image that you just built by copying the following command. If successful, you should see a URL in the
output on the command-line. Follow the link and you should see your app!

```shell
# run this command exactly (do not change anything!)
gcloud run deploy ${SERVICE_NAME} \
    --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${SERVICE_NAME}:latest \
    --region us-central1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated
```

### Set up automatic deployment in GitHub Actions

After a successful deployment, we can modify the `./github/workflows/cloud-run.yml`
file. Additional information on each step is in the [documentation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth?tab=readme-ov-file#workload-identity-federation-through-a-service-account)
 but you should be able to follow the steps below. **These steps should be done as a team, but only ONE person needs to run the commands.**

1. Decide on ONE team member's Cloud Project to use for the team project. That team member needs to go to **IAM & Admin** for their Cloud Project, click on **Grant Access** and add each team member's techexchange email as a "New Principle". For "Role", under **Basic** there should be **Editor**. Once every team member is an Editor for the project, every team member should be able to see the Cloud Project in the dropdown menu on the Google Cloud Console.

2. Create a Workload Identity Pool and a Provider for GitHub. Replace `your-common-cloud-project-name` with the team's Cloud Project name, `your-team-service-name` with a name for your team webapp, and `your-course-github-org` with the name of the GitHub organization for your class. You do NOT need to change `OIDC_NAME=project-repo`. Once you run the first set of commands, which set the `PROJECT_ID` and others as **bash variables**, you can copy and paste the next commands.

```shell
# set another 4 bash variables
PROJECT_ID=your-common-cloud-project-name
SERVICE_NAME=your-team-service-name
OIDC_NAME=project-repo  # do not change this line
GITHUB_ORG=your-course-github-org
```

```shell
# run this command exactly
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create "github" \
    --project="${PROJECT_ID}" \
    --location="global" \
    --display-name="GitHub Actions Pool"
```

```shell
# run this command exactly
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc "${OIDC_NAME}" \
    --project="${PROJECT_ID}" \
    --location="global" \
    --workload-identity-pool="github" \
    --display-name="My GitHub repo Provider" \
    --attribute-mapping="google.subject=assertion.sub,attribute.actor=assertion.actor,attribute.repository=assertion.repository,attribute.repository_owner=assertion.repository_owner" \
    --attribute-condition="assertion.repository_owner == '${GITHUB_ORG}'" \
    --issuer-uri="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
```

3. Get the full path name for the Workload Identity Provider from gcloud.
You will use the output from this command as the `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` 
field in `.github/workflows/cloud-run.yml`. You've already set the `OIDC_NAME` and the `PROJECT_ID` as bash variables in step 2 so you can just copy and paste this command!

```shell
# run this command exactly
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers describe "${OIDC_NAME}" \
    --project="${PROJECT_ID}" \
    --location="global" \
    --workload-identity-pool="github" \
    --format="value(name)"
# copy the output into cloud_run.yml as stated above
```

4. Authorize your service account. Use the output from the first command as the
`WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_ID`, your team's GitHub repo
name as the `GITHUB_REPO_NAME`, and the `GITHUB_ORG` with the name of the GitHub organization for your course. Once those are set as bash variables, run the last command. This sets your team's project's GCP service account to allow your specific GitHub repository access to deploy to your GCP project. You can get your `PROJECT_NUMBER` from the Cloud Console home page for your team's GCP project.

```shell
# run this command exactly
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools describe "github" \
  --project="${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --location="global" \
  --format="value(name)"
# copy the output to put into a bash variable
```

```shell
# set another 4 bash variables
WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_ID=paste-output-from-prev-command
PROJECT_NUMBER=yourcloudprojectnumber
GITHUB_ORG=your-course-github-org
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=your-github-team-repo-name
```

```shell
# run this command exactly
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --project="${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --role="roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser" \
  --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/${WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_POOL_ID}/attribute.repository/${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO_NAME}"
```

5. In IAM in the Cloud Console, double check that the following roles are attached 
to the service account, which is the `PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com` from the previous command.

    - Cloud Build Service Account

6. Update the environmental variables (all of the TODOs) in 
`.github/workflows/cloud-run.yml`, commit and push your changes, 
and click on "Actions" in your team's repository on GitHub to see
the workflows running! If the actions don't succeed, double check all of your previous commands, specifically all of the bash variables.
